# UK General Election Data Visualiser

## DEMO

Visit [https://b-xb.github.io/ge-data/](https://b-xb.github.io/ge-data/) to see a working demo.

## About

This is a small demo application using Vue.js and Chart.js to make graphs of UK election data.

It is very simple at the moment but I may well add in more features in the future.

## Possible Future Features

- More Filters
  - Filter by region
  - Filter by EU referendum data
  - More political parties
  - Filter by seats gained/lost

- Select Multiple
  - Show data for different political parties on the same graph

- Averages
  - Calculate average lines for certain sets of data

- Comparisons
  - Compare selected graph data side by side or combined into the same graph

- More data
  - Include more data from previous years
